==== version history of Log::Report

version 0.04: Mon Jun  4 11:05:10 CEST 2007
	- removed incorrect doc about "mode TRY", which does not exist.
	- included syslog in "reason" comparison table
	- have Makefile.PL install xgettext-perl
	- t/50file.t needed more work-arounds to pass automated module
	  tests (which go without -t STDERR)
	- attempts to make test-scripts run on various platforms.

version 0.03: Mon May 28 20:16:26 CEST 2007
	- Log::Report::Message without msgid forgot _append.
	- Log::Report::Message must clone at concatenation.
	- remove translations from POT when not referenced anymore, and
	  not translated either.
	- $@ after try will not show the message, because we want people
	  to use reportAll() or reportFatal().
	- dispatchers now have a format_reason, defaulting to LOWERCASE
	  which looks nicer than uppercase.
	- added docs to ::Try
	- reorganized some docs.
	- Log::Report::Util lacked the trailing "1;"
	- fall-back to no translation in case of unknown locale in ::POT
	- test functionality of setlocale, and hopefully fixed things

version 0.02: Mon May 28 00:49:52 CEST 2007
	- added HTML documentation to http://perl.overmeer.net/log-report/
	- added README and Changelog to MANIFEST
	- filters are not defined on the dispatcher object, but under
	  control of Log::Report::report().
	- Log::Report::Message new methods append(), msgid(), and prepend()
	- added Log::Report::Exception and Log::Report::Dispatcher::Try
	- added isValidReason() and isFatal() to Log::Report
	- added Log::Report::Message::untranslated();
	- Log::Report::report() will convert untranslated strings into
	  Log::Report::Message objects internally too.

	- by David Cantrell via cpan-testers:
	  . require at least perl 5.8.2, for POSIX :local_h and because
	    unique was broken before that release.
	  . t/00use.t cannot test LogDispatch and Gettext, because they
	    depend on optional module
	  . t/50file.t failed because no -t STDERR

version 0.01: Fri May 25 12:13:13 CEST 2007
	- initial (quite complete) implementation.
