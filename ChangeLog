==== version history of Log::Report

Connect to Message::Passing

version 0.992:

	Improvements:
	- add support for msgctxt in po-files to Log::Report::Lexicon::POT*
	- new option Log::Report::Lexicon::PO::new(plural_forms)
	- new generic base-class  Log::Report::Lexicon::Table for
	  Log::Report::Lexicon::POT*
	- ::POT.pm ignores any index when the msgid has no plural form. This
	  results in a smaller memory foot-print.
	- support for MO files, in  Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact

version 0.991: Mon Nov 26 09:27:08 CET 2012

	Fixes:

	- t/50file.t test failed on HASH order [cpantesters]

version 0.99: Wed Oct  3 09:13:58 CEST 2012

	Changes:

	- do not call overloaded stringification in stack-trace.

	Fixes:

	- do only include .po files in the index which are not
	  in a directory which starts with a dot (for instance,
	  not in /.svn/) or do not start with a dot.
	  [Richard Still]

	Improvements:

	- remove \r from the end of comment lines in PO files.

version 0.98: Thu Sep  6 14:46:52 CEST 2012

	Changes:

	- rewrote message-id extractor in ::Extract::Template to
	  support more TemplateToolkit features.

	- print __x("who am i\n") is now interpreted as
	  print __x("who am i"), "\n";
	  So: no trailing newlines in the PO-tables.

	Fixes:

	- PO file parse errors reported on the wrong location.

	- ::Message::toString() uses $" when an ARRAY of elements gets
	  inlined.  This should be the $" on the moment of message's
	  definition, not the $" when it gets stringified.

	Improvements:

	- new option ::Message::new(_join)

version 0.97: Mon Sep  3 15:54:04 CEST 2012

	Changes:

	  get numified automatically.

version 0.95: Thu Aug 30 23:15:50 CEST 2012

	- additional doc to dispatcher(), triggered by [Patrick Powell]

          as alternative to  report {to => $disp}, ERROR => 'xx';

version 0.91: Wed Jan 26 16:24:25 CET 2011

	  rt.cpan.org#41943 [Serguei Trouchelle]

	Improvements:

	- add Log::Report::needs() for convenience

version 0.20: Thu Dec 11 14:18:15 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- dispatcher does not convert output to a default charset, because
	  the optimal default cannot be established on most platforms.

	Fixes:

	- fix for Test::More interface change in 0.86.

	- strackTrace error with isa() when parameter string contains
	  a '::' and when a parameter is undefined.

	Changes:

	- changing the run-mode will change the accepted reasons as
	  well, because it was too complex to understand.

	Improvements:

	- complain if syntax option has an invalid value.

	- use warnings and strict in Win32Locale [cpants]

	- dispatcher command on "ALL" defined dispatchers.

	- use Log::Report mode => 'something'

	- exception can be re-throw-n with a different reason.

	- stop parse_locale() from complaining about locale==undef

	- ::Util::parse_locale() does a better job trying to conform
	  to various standards.  In SCALAR context, it now returns
	  more information.

	- avoid calling ::Dispatcher::DESTROY during global destruction,
	  because Perl produces horrible complaints for some releases of
	  Perl.

	- link manual-pages with Text::Catalog (renamed from
	  Log::Report::View)

version 0.14: Fri Nov  2 15:00:49 CET 2007

version 0.12: Tue Oct 23 15:26:07 CEST 2007

	Improvements:

	- t/04locale.t also tries charset eq ''

	- t/04locale.t will produce a warning, not an error, when the
	  setlocale() does not work

	- t/*.t will use the 'C' locale, not the less often supported
	  'POSIX'.

	- added Log::Report::Win32Locale, with experimental application
	  in Log::Report::Lexicon::Index

	- on some platforms, LC_MESSAGES is not defined.  Work-around
	  in Log::Report::Translator::POT.

version 0.11: Thu Oct 18 09:34:18 CEST 2007

	Fixes:

	- Running tests, a temporary directory remained in /tmp.

version 0.09: Thu Aug  9 22:46:56 CEST 2007

	Changes:

	- a try{} block executes eval in the correct context, and

	- a non-translated message MUST be only one string to be
	  passed to report(), because other parameters are passed
	  to the message constructor.

	Fixes:

	- stack-trace did not remove the trace of the Log::Report
	  internal helpers.

	- if try died indirectly from a nested died try, then that
	  object is not captured in died() itself.

	Improvements:

	- try() catches Perl die/croak/warn as well, and translates them
	  using Log::Report::Die.

	- try() dies if parameter list has odd length (semi-colon forgotten)

	- implementation of exception classes.
	  See Log::Report::(Message|Exception)::inClass

version 0.08: Wed Jul 11 14:09:32 CEST 2007

	- t/01locale.t even smarter, with help of Andreas Koenig

version 0.05: Thu Jun  7 13:18:13 CEST 2007
	Changes:
	- the stderr dispatcher will be opened when there is any
	  file at STDERR, not only a tty.

	Improvements:
	- simplified t/50files.t
	- another attempt to get t/01locale.t correct on all platforms
	- ::Util; locale parser must accept C and POSIX
	- ::Dispatcher; make message output format translatable
	- ::Extract::PPI; report mistake when msgid ends with new-line
	- ::Extract::PPI; mistake when a variable is interpolated in msgid
	- ::Extract::PPI; qq{} msgids will now be detected as well
	- ::Extract::PPI; special characters the "" and qq{} strings with
	  get interpreted (PPI does not do that automatically)
	- ::Extract::PPI: only report the nessecary
	- after a long discussion within Amsterdam.pm about concatenation
          of translated fragments, it was decided to permit it but put
	  some extra warnings in the docs.
	- also warn about __'xx'   meaning   __::xx '
	- updated log-report/nl_NL.po translations
	- configure native_language for a domain

	- removed incorrect doc about "mode TRY", which does not exist.
	- included syslog in "reason" comparison table
	- have Makefile.PL install xgettext-perl
	- t/50file.t needed more work-arounds to pass automated module
	  tests (which go without -t STDERR)
	- attempts to make test-scripts run on various platforms.

version 0.03: Mon May 28 20:16:26 CEST 2007
	- Log::Report::Message without msgid forgot _append.
	- Log::Report::Message must clone at concatenation.
	- remove translations from POT when not referenced anymore, and
	  not translated either.
	- $@ after try will not show the message, because we want people
	  to use reportAll() or reportFatal().
	- dispatchers now have a format_reason, defaulting to LOWERCASE
	  which looks nicer than uppercase.
	- added docs to ::Try
	- reorganized some docs.
	- Log::Report::Util lacked the trailing "1;"
	- fall-back to no translation in case of unknown locale in ::POT
	- test functionality of setlocale, and hopefully fixed things

	- added HTML documentation to http://perl.overmeer.net/log-report/
	- added README and Changelog to MANIFEST

	  control of Log::Report::report().
	- Log::Report::Message new methods append(), msgid(), and prepend()
	- added Log::Report::Exception and Log::Report::Dispatcher::Try
	- added isValidReason() and isFatal() to Log::Report
	- added Log::Report::Message::untranslated();
	- Log::Report::report() will convert untranslated strings into
	  Log::Report::Message objects internally too.

	- by David Cantrell via cpan-testers:
	  . require at least perl 5.8.2, for POSIX :local_h and because
	    unique was broken before that release.
	  . t/00use.t cannot test LogDispatch and Gettext, because they
	    depend on optional module
	  . t/50file.t failed because no -t STDERR

version 0.01: Fri May 25 12:13:13 CEST 2007
	- initial (quite complete) implementation.
